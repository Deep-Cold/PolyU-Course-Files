(a) Since **Merge($L_1,\ L_2$)** takes $\Omicron(\frac n3 + \frac n 3) = \Omicron(n)$ running time. The new array merged is of length $\frac n 3+\frac n 3 = \frac{2n} 3$. Thus **Merge$(L_0,\ Merge(L_1,\ L_2))$ ** takes $O(\frac n 3 + \frac {2n} 3) + O(n) = O(n)$ running time.

(b) $T(n) = 3T(\frac n 3) +\Theta(n)$

(c) According to the **Master Theorem**, $T(n) = 3T(\frac n 3)+\Theta(n^1)$, $1=log_33$. Thus we have $T(n)=\Theta(n\ log\ n)=O(n\ log\ n)$

### P2

Assume the DP-state $c[i,\ j]$ represent the LCS between the first $i$ characters in $S_1$ and the first $j$ characters in $S_2$. We have:
$$
c[i,\ j] =
\begin{equation}
\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
	x= 0 & if\ i = 0\ or\ j = 0\\
	c[i-1,\ j-1] + 1 & if\ i,\ j >0 \ and \ S_{1,i}=S_{2,j}\\
	max(c[i,\ j-1],\ c[i-1,\ j]) & if\ i,\ j>0\ and\ S_{1,i}\not=S_{2,j}
	\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
$$
The result is:

```
	j	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
i		S2	'i'	'n'	'e'	'q'	'u'	'a'	'l'	'i'	't'	'y'
0	S1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
1	'q'	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1
2	'u'	0	0	0	0	1	2	2	2	2	2	2
3	'a'	0	0	0	0	1	2	3	3	3	3	3
4	'n'	0	0	1	1	1	2	3	3	3	3	3
5	't'	0	0	1	1	1	2	3	3	3	4	4
6	'i'	0	1	1	1	1	2	3	3	4	4	4
7	't'	0	1	1	1	1	2	3	3	4	5	5
8	'y'	0	1	1	1	1	2	3	3	4	5	6
```

From the result, we can see that the **LCS** between $S_1$ and $S_2$ is `"quaity"`, whose length is $6$.

### P3

$\Omicron(n\ log\ n)$ Algorithm:

 We sort all the passenger's information with $end_i$ ascending. According to their $end_i$, we can put the $i_{th}$ person's information $i$ in the set $P_{end_i}$. Note that we specially deal with passengers whose $start_i=end_i$. We do not put them in any set, but add their $tip_i$ to $S_{end_i}$, which means we can obtain all their tips when we are available at $end_i$.

Formally speaking. $P_i=\{x:end_x=i\ \and\ start_x\not=end_x\},\ S_i={\sum_{x\in\{x:end_x=i\ \and\ start_x=end_x\}}}tip_x$

We defined the DP-state function $f_{i}$ represent the maximum number of dollars we can get when we are at point $i$ with no passenger on the taxi (There can be a passenger drop off at point $i$). 
$$
f_i=
\begin{equation}
\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
	0 & if\ i = 0\\
	max(f_{i-1},\ MAX_{p\in P_i}(f_{start_p}+(i-start_p)+tip_p)) &if\ i\not=0
	\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
\ +S_i
$$
Note that $MAX_{p\in P_i}$ means we choose the max value for the result of all $p$ in the set $P_i$.

$\Omicron(n)$ solution: 

We can find that because the range of $start_i$ and $end_i$ are within $1\sim n$. So we do not need to sort in our previous solution. We can directly divide all the information of passengers in corresponding set.

### P4

Algorithm: 

First, for all the rectangles, we assumed that their length $l_i$ are larger or equal to their width $w_i$. (If not, we can swap their length and width). 

Sort all the rectangles with their **length** in ascending order.

We have the DP-state function $F_{i}$ means the maximal number of rectangles ending with $i_{th}$ rectangles.
$$
F_i=
\begin{equation}
\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		0 & if\ i=0\\
		1 & if\ i=1\\
		max_{0\le j<i,\ w_j<w_i,\ l_j<l_i}\{F_j+1\} & if\ i>1
	\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
$$
And the final answer is $max\{F_i\}$

Proof:

For the first step we swap the length and width for $w_i>l_i$. It can be proved that if a solution have a rectangle with $w_i>l_i$. The rectangle contains $i$ is $k$, the rectangle be contained by $i$ is $j$. We have $l_k>w_i>l_j,\ w_k>l_i>w_j$. 

Since $l_k>w_i>l_i>w_j,\ l_j<w_i<l_i<w_k$, we have $l_k>l_i>l_j,\ w_k>w_i>w_j$. So, if we do rotate, we cannot find a better solution.

And for the second step, we sorted their $l_i$ in ascending order. When we perform DP later, we have consider all the $F_j$ whose $l_j<l_i$. Thus the correctness can be ensured.

Complexity:

For the first part we need to check each rectangle with complexity $\Omicron(n)$

For the next sorting part the complexity is $\Omicron(n\ log\ n)$

And the DP part we need check all the previous $j$ for each $i$. Thus the complexity is $\Omicron(n^2)$ 

The total complexity is $\Omicron(n) +\Omicron(n\ log\ n) + \Omicron(n^2) = \Omicron(n^2)$
