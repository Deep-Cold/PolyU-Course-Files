# The steps of running the code

1. Move the file **Customers.csv**, to the current directory. And use `setwd(...)` to set the working directory to the current directory.
2. Run all the codes before the comment `# Visualize the clustered data`. This part is the main body of the K-means algorithm to calculate the result.
3. Run the codes between `# Visualize the clutered points`  and `# Visualize the change of Jcluster` to get the mapping of the final clustered points.
4. Run the codes after `# Visualize the change of Jcluster` to get the line graph.
